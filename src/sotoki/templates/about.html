                <h2>Basic Stack Exchange's knowledge</h2>
                <p>Stack Exchange's websites are social platforms where anybody can post a question related to the site's topic and anybody can write answers or comments to it. Users can <em>Up-vote</em> or <em>Down-vote</em> answers and comments in order to distinguish those that are most useful.</p>
                <p>This voting gets computed into a per-question, per-answer, per-comment <em>Score</em> that is displayed thorough the website to help you skim to the most valuable content.</p>
                <p>When the user who raised a question is satisfied with an answer, he may mark it as <em>Accepted</em>. There is now a green mark <svg data-icon="Checkmark" class="fc-green-500"></svg> next to it to indicate that. The accepted answer can change overtime (in the online platform).</p>
                <p>Users interacting with the platform (receiving Up-vote for their answer for instance) are attributed “rewards” that gets computed into a <em>Reputation</em> which is a per-user Score.</p>
                <p>Additionnaly, Users receive badges depending on sub-topic specific actions. Badges are sorted in three levels: <span class="grid--cell badge1"></span> Gold, <span class="grid--cell badge2"></span> Silver and <span class="grid--cell badge3"></span> Bronze.</p>

                <h2>Limits of this copy</h2>

                    <li>Content is at least few weeks old because it's a one-shot export, not being updated until you download a new ZIM, most recent question being from {{ most_recent_date }}.</li>
                    <li>Views number correspond to number of Views on the online website at the time of the Dump. Yours are not counted.</li>
